# Grounds-Keeper
Opensource Discord Bot in Python - Revised with GPT-4
#Notes
GroundKeeper is written in Python. It is written to be hosted on Replit.com, but is pretty easy to transition for either another browser IDE or local hosting. The code is pretty self explanitory, and I try to have GPT-4 revise my comments to check anything I may have missed. This is a Co-Op project started by me; now joined by AcroTwit.

I encourage you to source this for your own bot if interested! I hope it is useful to you. I will continue to update this for the foreseeable future, I will make a note if ever abandoned.
